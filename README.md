Completed user stories:

Search results page
  Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
  Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
  Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does)
Filter page
  The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
  You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states
